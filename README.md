## 🆘 Why EmergencyFix?
In a crisis—like a burst pipe at midnight or a sudden electrical fire—users suffer from "panic paralysis." Standard search engines are too slow and cluttered. **EmergencyFix** provides a zero-friction, high-speed interface to connect victims with professional responders instantly.

## ⚡ Critical Emergency Features
* **One-Tap SOS Navigation**: Optimized UI designed for high-stress situations. Large, high-contrast icons ensure you find the right service (Plumbing, Electrical, Mechanical) without reading small text.
* **Zero-Barriers to Help**: No login, no signup, no waiting. The app is built to be "Ready-to-Use" the moment it loads.
* **Real-Time Visual Feedback**: Features a "Pulse UI" on critical buttons to guide the user's eye in low-light environments (like power outages).
* **Guaranteed Uptime**: Hosted on Vercel's global edge network, ensuring the app stays live and fast even during local network spikes.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Frontend Architecture**: Built with **React** for a fast, modular user interface.
* **Rapid Bundling**: Powered by **Vite** for sub-second load times.
* **Visual Identity**: Uses **Lucide-React** for universally recognized emergency icons.
* **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deployed via **Vercel** for 99.9% availability and instant global access.
