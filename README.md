# EFix: The Complete Home Care Ecosystem 🏠🛠️

EmergencyFix is a hybrid service platform. We solve the "Golden Hour" problem for home emergencies while providing a premium, verified experience for general home maintenance.

## 🚀 Dual-Service Model

### 1. The Emergency Mode (The "Rapido" Model)
* **Focus:** Power failures, gas leaks, water bursts, lockouts.
* **Speed:** Hyper-local matching for <15 min arrival.
* **Feature:** Instant "SOS" button on the home screen.

### 2. The General Fix Mode (The "Premium" Model)
* **Focus:** Regular plumbing, electrical upgrades, appliance repair, carpentry.
* **Experience:** Scheduled visits, transparent bidding, and verified experts.

## 🌟 Our "X-Factor": Live Video Diagnosis
Unlike any other app, EmergencyFix uses **Live Video Calls** before the technician arrives for both modes:
* **For Emergencies:** Immediate safety instructions (e.g., "How to shut off the gas valve") while the pro is in transit.
* **For General Fixes:** Accurate remote quoting and "parts-matching" so the pro arrives with the right tools the first time.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
1. **User Request:** User selects 'Emergency' or 'Standard Repair'.
2. **Geo-Matching:** System pings the nearest 'Active' technician.
3. **Pre-Arrival Video:** A 60-second WebRTC video call to diagnose the issue.
4. **Transparent Logistics:** Automated tool-list and cost estimation sent to the user.
5. **Secure Execution:** OTP-based entry and digital payment settlement.
6. 
 ## 🛠️ Tech Stack
1.**Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (Mobile App)
2.**Backend:** Node.js & Express
3.**Database:** MongoDB
4.**Live Video:** WebRTC / Agora API (For diagnosis)
5.**Maps:** Google Maps API (For technician tracking)
6.**Real-time:** Socket.io (For instant matching)

 ## 🗺️ Future Roadmap
* **Q3 2024:** Integration with Smart Home IoT sensors (App automatically alerts you if a leak is detected while you're out).
* **Q4 2024:** B2B Partnerships with Housing Societies and Insurance companies.
* **Q1 2025:** AI-powered Auto-Diagnosis (Using the camera to identify the part name and model automatically).

## 📈 Growth Potential
* **High Trust:** Video calls build immediate rapport between the user and technician.
* **Scalable Revenue:** Commission-based model on repairs + Premium subscription for "Zero-Delay" emergency response.
